# Data_Architecture
Collection of different data architectures for various use cases
I will try to outline in simple block diagrams data architecture for various use cases, such as:

1. Batch Data Pipelines
2. Streaming Data Pipelines
3. Analytical Data Architecture for Data Lake/Data Warehouse
4. Operation Data Architecture

I will try to include more use cases as we proceed. Contributions and comments are welcome!!
